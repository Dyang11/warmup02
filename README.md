This workout involves the comparison of different investment methods. 

The shiny app proviedes 5 different options to compare investment methods, most self explanatory based on the variable name. 

Included in the shiny app are two data visualizations. First is a timeline plot of three different investment methods (initial investment growing by the return rate every year, initial investment + fixed contribution which is the first investment plus an annual contribution, and initial investment + growing contribution which is the first investment plus a growing annual contirbution). Second, there is also a data table included with the precise values at each year. 

The facet option allows the user to compare each curve and visualize the growth of the investment with a shaded area.
